# Task 1: Boxplots
#----

# Produce a default boxplot to explore the distribution of the number of male vs. female customers 
# in the `Chicago.csv` bike sharing dataset:



# Color the box areas as "dodgerblue" and add the title description "Boxplot of male and female customers":


# Choose another color of your choice from the list of named colors in R:



# Produce a default boxplot to explore the distribution of the number of male vs. female customers 
# in the `Chicago.csv` bike sharing dataset. This time, add `usertype` as another predictor variable 
# to the equation:


# Change the "names" of the x-axis labels into "F.Customers", "M.Customers", "F.Dependent", 
# "M.Dependent" and "F.Subscribers", "M.Subscribers".
# (Hint: therefore you can use the "names" argument in the boxplot function.):


# Again, add the title "Number of male and female customers" and change the title size to 1.5. Also change the 
# size of the axis labels to 0.5:


# Color the box areas for female customers as "pink" and the boxe areas for male customers as lightblue1": 

#----
# Task 2: Figure regions and number of figures
#----

# Load the add-on package "colorspace". Change the setting of your figure region so that it allows for 
# 3 different plots. Fill-up the 3 regions with the color sets (diverging, sequential and rainbow) 
# of the colorspace package:

# helper function to display color palettes


# Rcolorspace palettes

# qualitative color sets


# sequential color sets


# diverging color sets


# Set all of the figure margins to zero and repeat the previous task:



# qualitative color sets


# sequential color sets


# diverging color sets


#----
# Task 3: Scatterplots in ggplot
#----

# Plot temperature vs tripduration. Color the plotting symbols according to gender:



# Again, plot temperature vs tripduration and color the plotting symbols according to gender. 
# This time, also consider the different weather events as "shape":


# Add the scale labels "Temperature" and "Tripduration", and the plot title "Scatterplot" to the plot:
 

# Add a color set of your choice of the ColorBrewer package to describe and highlight the patterns 
# in the data.
